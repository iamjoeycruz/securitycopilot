## Understanding Tokens 
AI tokens can be thought of as pieces of words. When using AI models like GPT-3, the input text is broken down into these tokens before processing. These tokens are not necessarily split exactly where words start or end; they can include trailing spaces and even sub-words. Here are some helpful rules of thumb for understanding tokens:

- 1 token is approximately equal to 4 characters in English.
- 1 token is roughly equivalent to ¬æ of a word.
- 100 tokens correspond to about 75 words or 1-2 sentences.
- 1 paragraph is approximately 100 tokens.
- 1,500 words translate to around 2,048 tokens.

Use tools like OpenAI's Tokenizer: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer
